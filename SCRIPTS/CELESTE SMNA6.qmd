## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/lenovo/Downloads/cirrosis.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
data_limpia <- data[!is.na(data$Trigliceridos),]

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
